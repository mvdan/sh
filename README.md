[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/mvdan.cc/sh?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/mvdan.cc/sh)
[![fuzzit](https://app.fuzzit.dev/badge?org_id=mvdan)](https://fuzzit.dev)

A shell parser, formatter, and interpreter. Supports [POSIX Shell], [Bash], and
[mksh]. Requires Go 1.13 or later.

### Quick start

To parse shell scripts, inspect them, and print them out, see the [syntax
examples](https://godoc.org/mvdan.cc/sh/syntax#pkg-examples).

For high-level operations like performing shell expansions on strings, see the
[shell examples](https://godoc.org/mvdan.cc/sh/shell#pkg-examples).

### shfmt

	GO111MODULE=on go get mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/shfmt

`shfmt` formats shell programs. It can use tabs or any number of spaces to
indent. See [canonical.sh](syntax/canonical.sh) for a quick look at its default
style.

You can feed it standard input, any number of files or any number of directories
to recurse into. When recursing, it will operate on `.sh` and `.bash` files and
ignore files starting with a period. It will also operate on files with no
extension and a shell shebang.

	shfmt -l -w script.sh

Typically, CI builds should use the command below, to error if any shell scripts
in a project don't adhere to the format:

	shfmt -d .

Use `-i N` to indent with a number of spaces instead of tabs. There are other
formatting options - see `shfmt -h`. For example, to get the formatting
appropriate for [Google's Style][google-style] guide, use `shfmt -i 2 -ci`.

If any [EditorConfig] files are found, they will be used to apply formatting
options. If any parser or printer flags are given to the tool, no EditorConfig
files will be used. A default like `-i=0` can be used for this purpose.

An example of the options available:

```editorconfig
[*.sh]
# like -i=4
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4

shell_variant      = posix # like -ln=posix
binary_next_line   = true  # like -bn
switch_case_indent = true  # like -ci
space_redirects    = true  # like -sr
keep_padding       = true  # like -kp
function_next_line = true  # like -fn

# Ignore the entire "third_party" directory.
[third_party/**]
ignore = true
```

Packages are available on [Alpine], [Arch], [Docker], [FreeBSD], [Homebrew],
[MacPorts], [NixOS], [Scoop], [Snapcraft], and [Void].

#### Replacing `bash -n`

`bash -n` can be useful to check for syntax errors in shell scripts. However,
`shfmt >/dev/null` can do a better job as it checks for invalid UTF-8 and does
all parsing statically, including checking POSIX Shell validity:

```sh
$ echo '${foo:1 2}' | bash -n
$ echo '${foo:1 2}' | shfmt
1:9: not a valid arithmetic operator: 2
$ echo 'foo=(1 2)' | bash --posix -n
$ echo 'foo=(1 2)' | shfmt -p
1:5: arrays are a bash feature
```

### gosh

	GO111MODULE=on go get mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/gosh

Proof of concept shell that uses `interp`. Note that it's not meant to replace a
POSIX shell at the moment, and its options are intentionally minimalistic.

### Fuzzing

This project makes use of [go-fuzz] to find crashes and hangs in both the parser
and the printer. To get started, run:

	git checkout fuzz
	./fuzz

### Caveats

* When indexing Bash associative arrays, always use quotes. The static parser
  will otherwise have to assume that the index is an arithmetic expression.

```sh
$ echo '${array[spaced string]}' | shfmt
1:16: not a valid arithmetic operator: string
$ echo '${array[dash-string]}' | shfmt
${array[dash - string]}
```

* `$((` and `((` ambiguity is not supported. Backtracking would complicate the
  parser and make streaming support via `io.Reader` impossible. The POSIX spec
  recommends to [space the operands][posix-ambiguity] if `$( (` is meant.

```sh
$ echo '$((foo); (bar))' | shfmt
1:1: reached ) without matching $(( with ))
```

* Some builtins like `export` and `let` are parsed as keywords. This is to allow
  statically parsing them and building their syntax tree, as opposed to just
  keeping the arguments as a slice of arguments.

### JavaScript

A subset of the Go packages are available as an npm package called [mvdan-sh].
See the [_js](_js) directory for more information.

### Docker

To build a Docker image, checkout a specific version of the repository and run:

	docker build -t my:tag -f cmd/shfmt/Dockerfile .

This creates an image that only includes shfmt. Alternatively, if you want an
image that includes alpine, add `--target alpine`.
To use the Docker image, run:

	docker run --rm -v $PWD:/mnt -w /mnt my:tag <shfmt arguments>

### pre-commit

It is possible to use shfmt with [pre-commit][pre-commit] and a `local`
repo configuration like:

```yaml
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: shfmt
        name: shfmt
        minimum_pre_commit_version: 2.4.0
        language: golang
        additional_dependencies: [mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/shfmt@v3.1.1]
        entry: shfmt
        args: [-w]
        types: [shell]
```
