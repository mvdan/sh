  - Implement operator precedence for `[[ ]]`
  - Parse `$(foo)` and ``foo`` as the same (`shfmt` then converts the latter to the former)
  - Rename `Quoted` to `DblQuoted` for clarity
  - Split `((foo))` nodes as their own type, `ArithmCmd`
  - Add support for bash parameter expansion slicing

## [0.3.0] - 2016-10-26

- Add support for bash's `coproc` and extended globbing like `@(foo)`
- Improve test coverage, adding tests to `cmd/shfmt` and bringing `parser` and `printer` close to 100%
- Support empty C-style for loops like `for ((;;)) ...`
- Support for the `>|` redirect operand
- **cmd/shfmt**
  - Fix issue where `.sh` and `.bash` files might not be walked if running on a directory
  - Fix issue where `-p` was not obeyed when formatting stdin
- **parser**
  - `$''` now generates an `ast.SglQuoted`, not an `ast.Quoted`
  - Support for ambiguous `((` like with `$((`
  - Improve special parameter expansions like `$@` or `$!`
  - Improve bash's `export` `typeset`, `nameref` and `readonly`
  - `<>`, `>&` and `<&` are valid POSIX
  - Support for bash's `^`, `^^`, `,` and `,,` operands inside `${}`

## [0.2.0] - 2016-10-13

- Optimizations all around, making `shfmt` ~15% faster
- **cmd/shfmt**
  - Add `-p` flag to only accept POSIX Shell programs (`parser.PosixConformant`)
- **parser**
  - Add support for ambiguous `$((` as in `$((foo) | bar)`
  - Limit more bash features to `PosixConformant` being false
  - Don't parse heredoc bodies in nested expansions and contexts
  - Run tests through `bash` to confirm the presence of a parse error
- **ast**
  - Add `Walk(Visitor, Node)` function

## [0.1.0] - 2016-09-20
